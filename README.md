# Cryptocurrencies
The purpose of this project was to help a fictional client analyze data on cryptocurrencies. The deliverable includes a Jupyter Notebook file that utilizes Pandas to clean and preprocess the data, reduces the dimensionality of the data via Principal Components Analysis, standardizes and clustering using Kmeans analysis, and visualizes the data using hvPlot.
